# xbox360-3D
xbox 360 custom shell project 
This project is early in developement and is constantly work in progress
We will start off with my personal 20th anniversary phat build
all stl's will need to be printed from abs, asa, petg or pc
print with 5 vertical walls, 5 bottom layers & 5 top layers with 25% gyroid infill
for this build the dvd rom is removed and internal 2.5 & 3.5 hdd's can be used which can be swapped without opening the console
mainboard sata mod will require the removal of hdd sata connector and install of 5 or 7 pin ph2.0 header (will eventualy make model for external hdd)
